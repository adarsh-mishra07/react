React Router is a library that provides routing capabilities for React applications.
Routing means handling navigation between different views.

React Router is the standard routing library for React applications. It enables you to:

Create multiple pages in your single-page application
Handle URL parameters and query strings
Manage browser history and navigation
Create nested routes and layouts
Implement protected routes for authentication
Without a router, your React application would be limited to a single page with no way to navigate between different views.
